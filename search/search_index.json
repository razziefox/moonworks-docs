Its implementation is heavily inspired by FNA , which is itself a free implementation of the Microsoft XNA API. MoonWorks wraps native-code implementations in managed C# for clean high-level abstractions that still run fast. It's simple and it tries to stay out of your way as much as possible. MoonWorks does provide the components you need to implement a functioning game: window management, input, graphics, 3D math utilities, and audio. MoonWorks does not include things like a built-in physics engine, a GUI editor, or a standard rendering pipeline. These decisions and tools are better made per-team or per-project. In short, if you don't mind learning what a vertex buffer is, this framework is for you. MoonWorks uses strictly Free Open Source Software. It will never have any kind of dependency on proprietary products.
